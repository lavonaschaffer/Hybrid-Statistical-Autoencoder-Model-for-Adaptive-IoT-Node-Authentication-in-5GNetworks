# Hybrid-Statistical-Autoencoder-Model-for-Adaptive-IoT-Node-Authentication-in-5GNetworks
This project addresses the problem of IoT de vice authentication by leveraging radio frequency (RF) fingerprints that capture unique hardware induced signal variations instead of relying on cryptographic credentials.
